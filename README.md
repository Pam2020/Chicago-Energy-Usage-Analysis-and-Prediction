# DATA602 Final Project: Chicago Energy Usage Classification problem

A machine learning project using the Chicago energy consumption data retrieved from the Chicago data portal. This is implemented as a part of DATA 602 course on introduction to machine learning. 

## Data Description

The data comrpises the energy usage in households, businesses, and industries in Chicago in the year 2010. The dataset consists of electricty and gas used for the months, characteristics of the distribution of usage over these months, and data related to building and occupancy characteristics. 
The dataset has 67051 instances and 73 attributes.  

## Problem Statement

Typically, energy usage depends on a lot of factors including the size of the building, occupany, and utility. In our data, we have some of these characterstics along with the energy consumption recorded. The building type variable categorizes the building as resindential, commercial and industrial. In this study, I will try to predict the building type based on the energy consumption statistics and the building characterstics given in the data. This would be a multi-class classification problem.
